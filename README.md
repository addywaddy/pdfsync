# PDFSync

## PDF Writer -> gulp -> browserSync -> PDF.js
Tired of manually having to generate PDFs and then open them to check that it's rendering correctly?

Yeah me too!

## Getting Started

1. `git clone git@github.com/addywaddy/pdfsync.git`
2. `cd pdfsync`
3. `npm install -g gulp`
4. `npm install`
5. `gulp`

Now edit the `prawn/my_pdf.rb` file and the browser will update to show your changes.

I happen to like Prawn for generating PDFs. If that's not your bag, change the render task and watcher to suite your needs.
